Personal website
======
I started created this website to describe my experience in financial environment envolving high-performance uses real projects in baseline days. 
I'm going to bring some details about how learning about technical drawing, technical talks, how the best way to share knowledge through meettings, some projects envolving Springboot, Kafka, Observability and tools to guide to you work better in the a Crazy Coporative World. 
The next topic I will gona share some repositories with skeletons. I high recommend to you see this content, because this is more easy if there information you really need or not, and bring some contexts about the articos I will providing in the topic "publications". 
                              

Getting started
------
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Start to simple one, just browsing a little bit to learning how works the github interface. 
1. Go to the browser search and start to look up for techinical topics or name of someone such as veronicarlima.
1. You are see all the projects and options to see all the files and examples.  
1. If you want the code, let's fork or just using clone option to download the project in your machine. 

Site-wide configuration
------
Most of the repositories had READ.ME with orientations to cordinate you have sucess to do the same as the author made in his computer.

By YourSelf - Create content & metadata
------
Now you can browser all of the files to have insites, continues build more things, make POCs, whatever you want, use your imagination to create ! Those project is basically skeleton to help learning, create resolutions, build new features, or just having fun. 


How create documentations ? 
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and Markdown files directly in the github.com interface, lets start of beginner, don't be shy, everyone starts begginer and with some routines you're be confident to do more frequentely, and even teaching someone the same way when you start!

***This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository***

More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/), the [growing wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
